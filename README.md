# SUPERSTORE COMPANY
This is a multi-national company. The product category includes Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture. I am going to observe the weakness in superstore company. The criteria is based on the Profitability as well as Sales, while the first one Profitability is more important at the current economic situation. I am going to find which category and sub-category give us the least profit and try to identify the root cause of that through Visual Analytics.

### Observations and Conclusions
I have created visualization for the sales of superstore company, furniture sales are the least profitable Category.Furniture category has some of the highest shipping costs.The category that gives us the least profit is Furniture and the sub-category that gives us the least profit is Furnishing.  There is a widespread spike in sales in August due to the annual back to school sale.
Sales and profits in Europe are less when compared to USA, this is probably because of high shipping costs in Europe when compared to USA. So, reducing the shipping costs in Europe, just like USA, might help to improve profits.

### Recommendations
Providing low shipping cost to increase the sales in furniture.
Tables are weakest sale product, and its sales should stop or more focus needs to be placed on the sale of tables.
Focusing more on high selling products like technology to increase sales.
